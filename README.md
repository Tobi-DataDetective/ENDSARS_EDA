### Technical Strategy

R programming was used to fetch the data from twitter , with all the yearly file from 2017 to 2021 locate [here](https://github.com/Tobi-DataDetective/ENDSARS_EDA/tree/main/EDA_R)

Exploratory Analysis done with R language can be located [here](https://github.com/Tobi-DataDetective/ENDSARS_EDA/tree/main/EDA_R)

Exploratory Analysis done in Python language can be located [here](https://github.com/Tobi-DataDetective/ENDSARS_EDA/tree/main/EDA_Python)

All images generated during the analysis located [here](https://github.com/Tobi-DataDetective/ENDSARS_EDA/tree/main/images) and [here](https://github.com/Tobi-DataDetective/ENDSARS_EDA/tree/main/images_2)

**Guide/Steps**
* Fetch the tweets 2017 to 2019 ([see file](https://github.com/Tobi-DataDetective/ENDSARS_EDA/blob/main/EDA_Python/Scraping.ipynb)) for 2020 to 2021 ([see file](https://github.com/Tobi-DataDetective/ENDSARS_EDA/blob/main/EDA_Python/Sraping2020_2021.ipynb)). Note: Because of the twitter ban in 2020, fetching the data in the same file was hard and had to fetch the tweets using another device that supports a VPN.
* Combine all tweets together ([see file](https://github.com/Tobi-DataDetective/ENDSARS_EDA/blob/main/EDA_Python/combining_scraped_data.ipynb))
* Performed Exploratory Data Analysis in [R](https://github.com/Tobi-DataDetective/ENDSARS_EDA/tree/main/EDA_R) and [Python](https://github.com/Tobi-DataDetective/ENDSARS_EDA/tree/main/EDA_Python) Language.
* Created a report on the analysis [see file](https://github.com/Tobi-DataDetective/ENDSARS_EDA/tree/main/report)
